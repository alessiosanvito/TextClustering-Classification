This project aims to classify reviews from a Steam dataset through some text classification
techniques; in particular, different BERT models have been used to compare their performance.
The results performed by the models implemented are evaluated even in comparison
with some other results obtained by different models implemented in papers online. This kind
of approach has been used even for the second task of the project, which is text clustering,
whose aim is to group reviews that express similar sentiments.
